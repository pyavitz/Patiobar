Patiobar

![Frontend Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/IUHo3tW.jpg)

A web frontend for pianobar, which is a CLI frontend for Pandora.

Provides a simple way for controlling what is playing on the radio.
I use this to allow guests (and myself) to control the music playing
outside on my patio with their phones.  

This was inspired by [Pidora](https://github.com/jacroe/pidora).
I wasn't happy with the way Pidora does templating so instead of
forking that project, I wanted to start fresh.  I also wanted to
learn NodeJS and socket.io (websockets), so this was a great
project for that.

A great way to control Pandora / Pianobar on a Raspberry Pi
